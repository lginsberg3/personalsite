      <h1>Teaching</h1>
      <p><i>"Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire."</i> -Plutarch </p>
      <p>My goal as an educator is to reveal the beauty of mechanics to my students. I hope they discover a spark in my classes that ignites their desire to explore further. While the equations and lecture details may eventually fade from memory, I aim for that spark to endure. With curiosity as their guide and equipped with the right tools and resources, they can confidently navigate the demands of their chosen professions.</p>
      <p>I have shaped my teaching methods through the careful observation of the many excellent teachers who inspired me throughout my education—mentors to whom I owe an immeasurable debt of gratitude. I’ve refined these methods through years of teaching, mentoring students and young engineers in industry, serving on committees, and developing a new online curriculum for Machine Design (MET 4501) at Kennesaw State University. With expertise in solid mechanics, machinery, and materials, I am well-equipped to teach a variety of courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels in mechanical engineering.</p>
      <p>I place great emphasis on fostering critical thinking and ethical responsibility. Engineering problems often involve complex decision-making with significant societal impacts, and I encourage students to consider both the technical and ethical dimensions of their designs. By presenting students with case studies on safety, product liability, and sustainability, I promote a classroom culture that values responsible innovation and prepares students to be mindful of their impact as engineers. For example, I had the opportunity to borrow one of the overheated bearings that caused the derailment of a Norfolk Southern train in East Palestine, Ohio early last year. I brought this into class to preface our discussion of roller element bearings and demonstrate the serious real-world consequences of machine component failure.</p>
