    <h1>Module Overview</h1>
    <p>
        This module provides a foundational overview of mechanical engineering design through the following key concepts:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Mechanical Engineering Design Overview (Ch. 1)</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Introduction to the design process.</li>
                <li>Exploration of how engineers develop functional products from initial ideas.</li>
                <li>Discussion of creativity, analysis, and optimization in design.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Load and Stress Analysis (Ch. 3)</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Introduction to forces, moments, and stress types.</li>
                <li>Fundamentals of free-body diagrams and their role in mechanical analysis.</li>
                <li>Application of load and stress concepts in machine design.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Materials and Material Properties (Ch. 2)</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Overview of common engineering materials and their applications.</li>
                <li>Key material properties influencing design, such as strength, ductility, and toughness.</li>
                <li>Considerations for material selection based on performance and cost.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This module lays the groundwork for understanding machine components and design principles in later modules.
