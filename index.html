    <h1>Teaching</h1>
    <p>My teaching goal is to prepare students to become critical thinkers and skilled engineers who can bridge theoretical knowledge with practical applications in a socially and ethically responsible manner. As an educator, I strive to create a classroom that fosters curiosity, collaboration, and resilience, guiding students to develop a strong foundation in mechanical engineering while equipping them with skills to adapt to the demands of the profession. I have developed my teaching skills and interests through teaching, mentoring students and young engineers in industry, serving on the education committee for a professional society, and developing a new online curriculum for my current machine design class at Kennesaw State University. My specialization in solid mechanics, machinery, and materials qualifies me to teach a range of courses at the graduate and undergraduate level in mechanical engineering.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I believe that effective engineering education lies at the intersection of theory and practice.</li>
      <li>My teaching methods prioritize an interactive, hands-on approach to learning.</li>
      <li>I am deeply committed to my studentsâ€™ growth, both in the classroom and beyond.</li>
    </ul>
