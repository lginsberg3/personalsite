      <h1>Teaching</h1>
      <p>My teaching goal is to prepare students to become critical thinkers and skilled engineers who can bridge theoretical knowledge with practical applications in a socially and ethically responsible manner. As an educator, I strive to create a classroom that fosters curiosity, collaboration, and resilience, guiding students to develop a strong foundation in mechanical engineering while equipping them with skills to adapt to the demands of the profession. I have developed my teaching skills and interests through teaching, mentoring students and young engineers in industry, serving on the education committee for a professional society, and developing a new online curriculum for my current machine design class at Kennesaw State University. My specialization in solid mechanics, machinery, and materials qualifies me to teach a range of courses at the graduate and undergraduate level in mechanical engineering.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I believe that effective engineering education lies at the intersection of theory and practice.</li>
        <li>My teaching methods prioritize an interactive, hands-on approach to learning.</li>
        <li>I am deeply committed to my studentsâ€™ growth, both in the classroom and beyond.</li>
      </ul>

    <h1>Research</h1>
    <p>My research centers on materials science and mechanical engineering, with a particular focus on enhancing the durability and safety of components critical to industrial applications. Through my work, I seek to bridge foundational principles and practical solutions, contributing research that directly impacts the safety, efficiency, and resilience of engineered systems. From my early research on the mechanical properties of living cells to my current work on U-bolts and future projects on other machine components, my research is driven by a desire to solve real-world engineering challenges.</p>
