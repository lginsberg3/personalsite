        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I am a passionate and dedicated engineering professional and college professor with a strong commitment to advancing both academic excellence and practical engineering solutions. With extensive experience in industry and research, I bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and real-world applications, particularly in areas such as mechanical design, material performance, and bolted joint analysis.</p>
        <p>At Caltech, I received a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering in 2021 and a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering in 2019. I received a Bachelor of Science degree from Georgia Tech in 2016.</p>
        <p>Diversity, equity, and inclusion are essential for fostering a vibrant academic environment where students, faculty, and staff can fully realize their potential. My commitment to creating inclusive educational spaces is deeply personal and has developed over years of observing how differences in background shape opportunities.</p>

      <h1>Teaching</h1>
      <p><i>"Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire."</i> -Plutarch </p>
      <p>My goal as an educator is to reveal the beauty of mechanics to my students. I hope they discover a spark in my classes that ignites their desire to explore further. While the equations and lecture details may eventually fade from memory, I aim for that spark to endure. With curiosity as their guide and equipped with the right tools and resources, they can confidently navigate the demands of their chosen professions.</p>
      <p>I have shaped my teaching methods through the careful observation of the many excellent teachers who inspired me throughout my education—mentors to whom I owe an immeasurable debt of gratitude. I’ve refined these methods through years of teaching, mentoring students and young engineers in industry, serving on committees, and developing a new online curriculum for Machine Design (MET 4501) at Kennesaw State University. With expertise in solid mechanics, machinery, and materials, I am well-equipped to teach a variety of courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels in mechanical engineering.</p>

      <h1>Research</h1>
      <p>My research centers on materials science and mechanical engineering, with a particular focus on enhancing the durability and safety of components critical to industrial applications. Through my work, I seek to bridge foundational principles and practical solutions, contributing research that directly impacts the safety, efficiency, and resilience of engineered systems. From my early research on the mechanical properties of living cells to my current work on U-bolts and future projects on other machine components, my research is driven by a desire to solve real-world engineering challenges.</p>
